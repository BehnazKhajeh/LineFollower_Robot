**code for move by detecting Black lines**

üöÄ Project Overview
This project brings the world of robotics to life with a simple yet fascinating Line Follower Robot. Utilizing **Arduino Uno** (or similar older models), **IR sensors**, and **DC motors**, this robot is capable of detecting and following a line on the floor. A great project for exploring the basics of robotics, sensor integration, and motor control.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Intelligent Line Detection: The robot uses two IR sensors to detect the line and make decisions.

Autonomous Movement: It follows the line by moving forward, turning left, or turning right based on the sensor feedback.

Motor Control: The robot can stop, move forward, or turn using DC motors controlled via a motor driver.

üîß Components
Arduino Uno 

2x IR Sensors (for detecting the line)

2x DC Motors

Motor Driver (L298N)



üì° Circuit Diagram
Pin Mapping:
IR Sensors: Connected to digital pins 2 (left sensor) and 3 (right sensor).

DC Motors: Controlled through the motor driver connected to pins 4, 5, 6 for the left motor, and 7, 8, 9 for the right motor.

üë®‚Äçüíª Code Overview
The Line Follow Robot is controlled by a straightforward program that processes the sensor readings and directs the robot accordingly:

If both sensors detect the line, the robot moves forward.

If only the left sensor detects the line, the robot turns right.

If only the right sensor detects the line, the robot turns left.

If neither sensor detects the line, the robot stops.
